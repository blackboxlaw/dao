### Interests
I enjoy action sports and am super-interested in 
decentralized ledger technology and data encryption systems,
specifically digital evidence management for real-world court systems.
I lived just east of San Francisco for a few years when I was younger, 
and I now I live in southern California about halfway between Los Angeles 
and San Diego with my wife and dogs. 
My kids recently went off to college so now I want to help change the world through technology.
I have a degree in business administration and marketing, and a law degree which helps get to the point.
